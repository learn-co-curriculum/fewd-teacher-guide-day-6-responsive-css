## Objectives
* Students learn how to use responsive media queries to make sites that look good on screens as well as their phones

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Students should have an understanding of how web pages dynamically change to accomodate users on mobile phones, tablets and personal computers, regardless of the size of their browser window
* Students should be able to use CSS to respond to changes in viewport
* Students should be able to write conditional CSS media queries to trigger changes in layout based on user device type and screen size

### Caveats

* Some group discussion to preface this content may be useful. Pick a responsive website that looks fundamentally different on the phone compared to a student's laptop
* It should be emphasized that creating responsive sites can be a complex process that takes considerable time to test.  This may be a good time to introduce the *device toolbar* within the Chrome inspector, where it is possible to mimic the displays of a variety of phones.
